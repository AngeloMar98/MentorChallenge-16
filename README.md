## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was my first time handling multiple themes for a web page, I couldn't wait to do it sooner or later. The CSS side of the challenge I'm really happy with, maybe the top side of the calculator uses too many flexboxes but don't cause any problem. I basically use 0 media queries since the content takes straight 100vh and the calculator just needs a max-width to contain for desktop view, so it's all good. It was planned as mobile-first though, and it looks good there
The calculator logic in Javascript though is REALLY messy, I did came up with it on my own, but it's basically reinventing the wheel. It's something you just take from somewhere else probably, but I did practice some DOM manipulation and switch so it's all good.
